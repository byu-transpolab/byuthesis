\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Outline}

This chapter describes the basics of using the template to meet BYU's
thesis formatting requirements. There is also a good deal of filler text to
make it look like a full document. The first paragraphs of each section discuss
real stuff.

All the titles in this document use a defined style. Chapter should
be used for chapter titles, section for sections, and subsection for
second-level headings. Use the \verb+\chapter{}+ command for chapters,
\verb+\section{}+ for sections, and \verb+\subsection{}+ for second-level
headings.

\subsubsection{Additional outlines}

The \texttt{byuthesis} class does define a third-level heading
at \verb+\subsubsection{}+, but there are no formatting instructions on this so
you might want to skip it.

\subsection{Figures}

Figures
can be included with the standard \LaTeX \ figure commands; every figure should
be referred to in the text, such as the diagram of sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS) incidence rates in North Carolina show in Figure \ref{fig:ncplot}.
Use the \LaTeX \ figure referencing / labels system to make your life easy.
\LaTeX \ will also correctly position the table on the page, either at the
top of a page or on its own page.

Figure captions should be one or more sentences that end in a period.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/ncplot}
  \caption{\label{fig:ncplot} Incidence of SIDS in North Carolina.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

Tables can also be included with the standard \LaTeX \ table commands, with
references and labels. The thesis class equips the recommended you use the
\texttt{booktabs} library, which includes commands to introduce horizontal
rules in tables.

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
\caption{\label{tab:example} An Example Table}
\begin{tabular}{lcccccl}
  \toprule
