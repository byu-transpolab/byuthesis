\begin{abstract}
This document describes the use of a new \LaTeX \ template for writing masters
theses at Brigham Young University. This was made necessary by the relative age
and complication of prior templates.

The abstract of a thesis should describe the
motivation, objective, overall results, and central findings of the thesis.
It may have multiple paragraphs if necessary.
