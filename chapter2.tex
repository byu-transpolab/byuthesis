\section{Citations}

This template is set up to use the \texttt{biblatex} citation engine. You can make
in-text citations like \textcite{RN81} with the \verb+\textcite{}+ command, and
parenthetical citations with \verb+\parencite{}+, like \parencite{RN35}.
You can change the citation style by setting the \texttt{style=} biblatex
option in the master \TeX \ file.

If you use biblatex properly, your bibliography will build itself and will
contain a reference for every cited work. You will also have no orphan references.
